what is an array?

An array is a finite and ordered collection of homogeneous data elements. It is finite because it contains a limited number of elements.
It is ordered because all the elements are stored one by one in a contiguous location of computer memory (heap) in a linear fashion.
It is homogeneous because all elements of an array are of the same data type only. We can store either primitive types or object references into it.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
for eg - if we want to store a list of numbers 1-10.
method 1 -  declare 10 int variables, use for loop to take input.
method 2 -make use of arrays

defining array  = datatype[] variablename = new datatype[length array];

looping through array - normal for or using for each

multidimensional array -  array inside an array
defining nested array  = datatype[][] variablename = new datatype[length array][inner array length];
we can traverse using a nested for loop.

copying array - using for loop and using System.arrayCopy.

can we assign array without size? no, it throws compile time error
can we declare negative array size? no it throws run time error


Advantages of Array
-We can store multiple elements of the same type under a single variable.
-We can implement other data structures such as Stack, Queue, Tree, etc. with the help of an array.
-We can fetch data elements using the index at run time.

Disadvantages of Array
-Before using an array, it is mandatory to declare its size.
-It is a static structure, so we cannot increase or decreases memory allocation.
-Insertion and deletion operations are difficult because elements stored at the contiguous memory location. It also increases the cost.
-Allocate more memory than required is the wastage of memory.
