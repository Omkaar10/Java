Class
- a blueprint for a house, you use the blueprint to build many houses.
- each house you build is object also known as instance.
- each house you build has an address - this is called reference.
- we can pass references to programs and constructors.

difference between this and super keyword
- super is used to access or call parent class member
- this is used to access or call current class member
- cannot use them in static methods.

- this is used in constructor and getters but not in setters


- super is used in method overriding, calls method with same name as parent class

- this() used to call another constructor in constructor overloading.
- super() used to call parent constructor.
call to super constructor must be first operation.

constructor can call this() or super() but not both.
use constructor chaining -  to avoid code duplication.

Method overiding and method overloading

Method overloading
- overloading means providing 2 or more separate method with same name but different parameters
- method return type may or may not be same.
- overloading have nothing to do with polymorphism but referred as compile time polymorphism.
- overloading happens inside a single class but a method can be overloaded in subclass of that class.
methods must have same name, different parameters.


Method Overriding
- defining methiod in child clas that exists in parent class with same signature.
- known as runtime polymorphism.
- it is recommended to put @Override, before overridden method.

must have same name and arguments
return type can be subclass of return type.
it cant have lower access modifier.

only inherited method can be overridden.
contructor and private methods cannot be overridden.
methods that are final cannot be overridden.
a subclasss can use super.methodname() to call super class overridden method.




Static and Instance methods

Static method are decalred using static modifier
cant access instance method and variables
cant use this() keyword.
a method which doesnt use instance variable should be made static method.


Instance methods
belong to specific instance of class
have to instatiate a class before use.
can use instance method and variables.
